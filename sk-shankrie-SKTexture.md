# SKTexture

SKTexture object manages the texture data and graphics resources needed to render the image. Once created, a texture objectâ€™s contents are immutable.

Loading and preparing texture data is expensive so SprietKit defers these actions and provides methods to control it.

Important methods:
* textureWithImageName: - creates SKTexture object from an image file
* textureWIthImage: - creates SKTexture from an inage object

Important properties:
```swift
var filteringMode: SKTextureFilteringMode // filtering mode of a texture
    // Possible values: 
    // - .Nearest
    // - .Linear
func size() -> CGSize // size of a texture. Calling this method causes an image file to load from file```

Declaration example:
```swift 
convenience init!(imageNamed name: String)
```
