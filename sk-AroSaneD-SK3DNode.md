#SK3dNode

A SK3DNode object is a Sprite Kit node that renders a Scene Kit scene as a 2D textured image. Use SK3DNode objects to incorporate Scene Kit content into a Sprite Kit-based game. When Sprite Kit renders the node, the Scene Kit scene is animated and rendered first. Then this rendered image is composited into the Sprite Kit scene.

Use the scnScene property to specify the Scene Kit scene to be rendered.
